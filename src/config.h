// 1.75" AMOLED board is the default so existing builds are unaffected.

// ui.cpp are in that design space. UI_S() maps them onto whatever panel is built for.
// Both operands are compile-time constants, so on the 466 board this folds to the
// identity at compile time and the original build is bit-for-bit unaffected.
