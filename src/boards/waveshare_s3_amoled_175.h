// Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75 — the original target board.
//
// ESP32-S3R8, 8 MB PSRAM, 16 MB flash. CO5300 AMOLED 466x466 over QSPI, CST9217 touch,
// QMI8658 IMU, PCF85063 RTC, AXP2101 PMIC, ES8311 audio.
//
// Values here were taken from the Waveshare board definition and a working Arduino_GFX
// port, never guessed. See docs/HARDWARE.md.

// mDNS name and setup AP, named after the chip so the address says which board
// you are looking at. Both used to answer to skyglass.local, which meant only
// one was reachable when two were powered on.

// still more than the panel shows at once, and it hands back five kilobytes of a pool
// that was sitting at 79% used with the assert handler wired to reboot.
