// Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4C — 4" round IPS, 720x720, MIPI-DSI.
//
// STATUS: running on hardware. Display, touch (GT9271), audio codec, WiFi via the C6,
// the ADS-B feed, the web config page and OTA are all confirmed working. See
// docs/PORT_P4.md.
//
// Hardware, from the vendor wiki (waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4C):
//   ESP32-P4NRW32   dual-core RISC-V (HP) + 40 MHz RISC-V (LP)
//   32 MB PSRAM in package, 32 MB NOR flash over QSPI
//   4" round IPS 720x720, MIPI-DSI 2-lane
//   ESP32-C6-MINI-1 Wi-Fi 6 / BT5 co-processor, attached over SDIO -- the P4 itself
//     has NO radio. Networking goes through esp_hosted, not the native Wi-Fi stack.
//   MIPI-CSI 2-lane camera header, SDIO 3.0 TF slot, ES8311 audio codec
//
// Provenance is tagged per value:
//   [VENDOR]    from ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-XC-Demo.zip (Arduino/libraries/displays)
//   [COMMUNITY] from an ESPHome config for this board; plausible, not vendor-confirmed
// Per CLAUDE.md nothing here is guessed: it is sourced or it stays -1.

// mDNS name and setup AP, named after the chip so the address says which board
// you are looking at. Both used to answer to skyglass.local, which meant only
// one was reachable when two were powered on.

// ---------- Screen geometry ----------
// 720x720 is 2.4x the pixels of the 1.75" board. Radar radius keeps the same proportion
// of the panel (218/466 = 0.468) so the scope fills the round bezel identically.

// ---------- Shared I2C ----------

// by stepping the duty with the auto-dim disabled: 25% (64) is visibly dim and correct,
// 20% (51) and 15% (38) are both indistinguishable from off. So the cut-in sits between
// 51 and 64: the idle level is 64 rather than the S3's 25, and anything non-zero is
// floored at 64 so the brightness slider cannot be dragged into the dead zone by hand.

// ---------- GNSS over UART (optional add-on) ----------
// A plain NMEA module wired to the 40-pin expansion header (J2). GPIO20 and GPIO21 are
// brought out there and are claimed by nothing else on this board: the panel is MIPI-DSI
// (no GPIOs), touch and the codec sit on 7/8 and 9-13, the ESP32-C6 link uses 14-19, the
// CH343P debug UART is 37/38 and the audio PA is 53.

// ---------- microSD (SDMMC slot 0) ----------
// Not a board choice: the P4 multiplexes SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_0 onto GPIO39-48 through the
// IO MUX, so these signals cannot be routed anywhere else (ESP32-P4 datasheet, "SD/MMC
// Host Controller > Pin Assignment"). Free on this board -- touch is 7/8, the codec
// 9-13, the C6 link 14-19, GPS 20/21, the debug UART 37/38 and the audio PA 53.

// LVGL draw buffer height. A taller buffer was tried on the theory that fewer, larger
// chunks would cut per-chunk overhead: 160 lines made no difference at all -- 85 ms a
// frame either way -- so the cost is pixel work, not chunk setup. Left at 40.
//
// The sweep tick is left at the shared default too. A finer 12 ms tick was tried on the

// example (GFX_ESPWiFiAnalyzer.ino) uses plain WiFi.h -- WiFi.mode/scanNetworks -- with
// no hosted-specific init, so the standard API is expected to work unchanged. The flag
// stays for code that may still want to know there is no native radio.
